      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off.

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely.

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does.

Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too.

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses.

It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them.

Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what.

She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what.

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too.

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly.

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses.

Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what.

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too.

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them.

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does.

It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does.

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk.

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too. This became and argument that resulted in Mary’s sister Stomping off back upstairs. Mary hates having arguments and felt kinda bad, but she tried brushing it off. Later that day Mary received a text telling her that she was an asshole and \"what would happen if I was allergic!\" Mary really doesnt want to get rid of her cats, they dont cause any trouble and they stay downstairs no matter what. Not to mention Mary got permission from her mother who owns the property and she never told Mary she had to ask permission from her sister before she does. But Mary thought she needed some more opinions so IMTA?\n",

      "IMTA for getting a cat without her sisters permission? In the beginning of 2020 there were rumors about the pandemic spreading fast and how Mary’s area might shut down soon. She technically lives with just her sister. they own a decently large house, she takes over the downstairs and Mary’s sister owns the upstairs. The property is family owned and they both have to pay their mom to continue living there. Now Mary rarely ever visits upstairs and her sister rarely ever goes downstairs, they both have their own entrances and rarely have a reason to do so, so it feels like they are in their own houses. Because of this wanted to get a pet to help her throughout the pandemic so she doesnt feel as lonely. It wasn't that Mary couldn't visit her sister whenever she wanted to its more just they dont really have the best relationship. Mary contacted her mother about it to see if she could and after getting permission she started looking at possible kittys to adopt. Mary originally set out for only one but instead she got 2 super cute Calico sisters both being around 7 and SUPER cuddly. She instantly fell in love when she first met them and even today she still absolutely adores these two. Well she has had them for awhile now since she has gotten them in the beginning of covid and its now nearly the end of 2020. Her sister had only recently found out about Mary’s cats. Apparently her sister heard one of them meowing pretty loudly while Mary was out for her morning jog and went downstairs to see what it was all about. When Mary got home that day her sister came downstairs to ask her when she got the cats and why she didn't tell her about them. Mary told her that she got them almost a year ago and that she never had a reason to tell her about them since the topic of pets never got brought up in conversation and that they rarely talk. Mary’s sister was clearly agitated and told Mary she had to get rid of them because she \"didnt ask her permission\" and that the house was Mary’s sister’s too.
