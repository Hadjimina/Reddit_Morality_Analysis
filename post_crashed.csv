1fy0bx,"I work in an office that requires me to wear a suit all the time.  I work more hours than everyone.  Show up first, leave late, etc.  The office has an air conditioning system which I turn on and set to 72ยบ every morning.  We don't run it at night.  It's in New England and humid as fuck, so when you come in early, the place is dripping wet making it easy to feel uncomfortable at 70ยบ when you always have to wear a coat and long pants.  But after an hour of dehumidifying, 72ยบ is fine.  A co-worker of mine who only comes in once a week (and usually late) comes in dressed in designer clothes fit for going to the beach on a hot day and announces that it's too cold in here.  I can't wear less and be dressed appropriately, and management isn't going to take the risk of criticizing a woman's fashion choices.   I told her to wear a freaking sweater and left the AC on.  *Am I the Asshole?*

1yugsc,"I love the musical *Les Miserables*. A coworker of mine said that they didn't like it. I asked why and they said, among other things, that ""it's not a musical, it's an opera.""

Now, I happen to be an opera singer. I told them adamantly that it is NOT an opera. There are a number of things that make this true, but if you can take my word for it- and I hope you can- it's not a matter of opinion whether a mainstream musical is an opera or not. It is a musical, period.

My coworker thought otherwise. ""My boyfriend writes musicals and he agrees with me"" was the extent of her argument. Well, he may well write musicals but that doesn't mean he knows anything about opera. You might as well ask a jazz pianist to tell you about Beethoven- it's not the same area of expertise even if it's related.

1yuj95,"Backstory: I'm a semi-professional competitive gamer (on a throwaway, won't go into much more detail) who goes to events, and plays for money. I live at home with my mother, stepfather, younger brother and younger sister.

The hours my team and I play are between 6pm and 12am every night, although not for 6 hours continuously; it may be 9pm till 12am, or 6pm till 10pm, etc. and obviously I'm talking during those hours. Whenever my mother tells me they're going to bed though, I always do my best to keep it down and get offline as soon as possible. Sometimes I'll be in an important game though, so it takes me a little while before I stop talking.

Over the past few weeks or so, my console has started booting me offline without fail between the hours of 11pm and 12am. This is a huge issue because I'll be booted during a big game fairly often and I'll be unable to connect again until the next day. It also means it's a huge burden on my teammates as we often lose out on an hour of practice. It never really occurred to me that my stepfather could've put parental controls on (I'm 18).

Then, last night, at the same time, my PC's internet went off too. It's usually just my console, so I was pretty confused. Then my browser came up with a window saying 'This system is being blocked from accessing the internet.', so I immediately knew what was up. I went on my phone, accessed the browser page from my phone and tried to disable it that way. I couldn't guess the password though, so I went to the 'password override' option which involves holding a button physically on the router, putting in the serial number, wireless key and a new password. I waited until everyone had gone to bed, then went downstairs and did that. After that I accessed the parental controls, and there was a block for both my Xbox and my PC from 23:00 to 07:00. I deleted both of them, went back upstairs and continued on my PC.

So now my stepfather doesn't know the new password (although he could do the same override I did if he figures out how) and I don't get booted offline anymore. Am I an asshole for doing this, all because I game competitively and am trying to win money from winning events?","[AITA] I 'hacked' our house router, changed the password and turned off all the parental controls",[deleted],33,1393290715,42

1yvb3n,"I'm a college student. My first roommate dropped out in October, and I got a new one to start he 2nd semester. He's the worst. Here's some of the undesirable qualities about him.

* Incredible snoring. I had no clue someone could snore this loud and not wake his or her self up until now. He sounds like a fucking animal sometimes. He tops it off by moaning in his sleep after the loudest snores. You can hear it throughout my entire suite, even with doors clothes. I haven't approached him about it, but I know he knows about it. A friend of his spent the night in our room a few weekends ago, and one of the first things she said was ""have you told him about your snoring??"" He kind of brushed it off and quickly changed the subject. So he knows. He has to know. It's too loud not to know. This is fine, you can't help snoring sometimes. That being said, he sleeps *12 fucking hours a day*. On Mondays like today he sleeps for 8 hours then naps for 4 hours during the day. Nothing like coming to your dorm from a long day of class to your jackhammer going berzerk in the bed next to you. I'm not to pleased. Why does he sleep so much? It connects to my next point...

* He's a lazy fuck. He's very fat, and makes no attempt to change that. He has the attitude that everyone is perfect just the way they are, and no one should change. I think it's because it would be hard for him to change for the better. He eats insane amounts of food sometimes. In addition to this, he doesn't do anything recreational. All I see him do with his time is sleep, go to class (which is fantastic), lay on his bed with his laptop, and sit in the lounge of my dorm. He doesn't help with room keep up at all. Most of these qualities seem pretty innocuous, but let me get to my last quality..
* He is an absolute immature cretin on social media. His stream of conscience reminds me of my 13 year old sister. He tweets about Disney, vodka, complaining, and preaching. Recently the city my college is located in (Raleigh) had a snowstorm that included a traffic emergency. Everything was on lockdown. That didn't stop him from ordering his second pizza of the day, making the delivery guy walk to give it to him and brag about it on twitter. Just tonight, he tweeted that a ""stupid bitch was facetiming on the top of her lungs in the study lounge like a valley girl, girl please shut up with your iphone 3"". I knew the girl facetiming, so this kinda got under my skin. She wasn't even in the study lounge!. I got to talking with all my friends about it.

Tonight though, I thought about something. I am talking about him a lot. I mean, he gives me a lot to talk about. However, I feel like I may be just as bad as he is, talking about him and the things he does with my friends and floormates behind his back. So, am I the asshole? Am I the asshole for talking about him so much and making such a big deal out of him, or is he simply the asshole and I'm responding to that?

1yxnp3,"I'm likely going to get some flak for arguing with someone over the phone, but the fact that I couldn't speak with her face-to-face was actually the reason this whole thing happened in the first place. 

  This former friend of mine often met with me for lunch or coffee or whatever every so often, and we'd make a day of it, as we lived in towns roughly 100 miles apart. To do this, we typically arranged something via text message, which worked totally fine. 

  Anyway, the last time I saw her was in November, and admittedly she was, at the time anyway, busy with a number of commitments and problems that had come up. However, I have my own commitments including a job and voluntary events, and she was totally aware of this, as well as being aware that I was also similarly going through a number of issues of my own. It cannot have been an issue of time as she had more free time than I do and a lot more money than me too, despite being on welfare benefits and getting things like a house (something I would so desperately love) pretty much given to her. Then she meets me and whines about how terrible the house is or how she's bored sitting in the house all day, knowing fine and well I've got to work for the little money I earn. 

 Anyway, we agreed in November that we'd try and meet in December, just before Christmas. When this didn't happen, I hoped that we could at least have a coffee before the New Year came round and I would be busy at work. In both cases it was always some excuse or another, and eventually New Year came without me hearing a single word from her. 

  So come the middle of January I rang her and asked her what was happening. She promised me **faithfully** that in two weeks time (the start of Febuary) she'd meet me. This, like the other previous times, she told me she couldn't meet me and it would be two weeks before she could meet me. I told her that she should ring me in a week and let me know what was happening, as I'd had some holidays booked from work and so was freer than usual to meet. 
   
  I made a point of waiting until last week to give her some space, but when the usual promise of meeting in two week's time got trotted out, I gave her an ultimatum via text. I'll bulletpoint the texts in paraphrased fashion:

* **Text 1**: Look, all I'm asking for is a date. I've got my work and I'm also bored of getting messed around, bearing in mind I'm being promised you'll meet me. 

*Her response: Yeah well I've got problems in my life and all I'm trying to do is be a good friend, and you're making demands of me and being horrible to me.*

**Text 2**: Well yeah, I've got problems too. Also, you did stuff wrong too, and you seem more interested in yourself than anyone, despite you calling me a friend**

*Her response: Well this is all your fault, you seem to think your whole life is dependent on me. Just go and do whatever you want, I don't care.*

**Text 3 (final text)**: Surprise, surprise, it's my fault. Act like an adult, not a kid, and actually realise that you're not the centre of my life, and that you're acting like it's the end of the world because I actually want to know what's happening in my life, bearing in mind you're expecting me to spend good money on petrol and food. 

  This prompted a long, rambling phonecall (which I ignored for the most part) about how she 'wasn't friends with me any more' and how she hated me. Since then I haven't heard a word from her. 

  So, who is the asshole in this situation?

He never admitted it until recently but he liked the attention he got from them. But back to my point, he totally left me in the dust while he ran off with Hannah and the junior girls. I spent the better part of my freshman year trying to get the junior girls' attention (which I regret wholeheartedly) and it failed. In fact, it ended up making me look even worse, and pathetic. Fast forward to the beginning of this year, where I apparently made Hannah mad in a way that I don't really recall (it was several months ago) which made her chew me up saying that I ""ruin friendships"" and that I'm ""one of the rudest people she's ever met."" Which made the junior girls hate me even more. Looking back I realize how stupid I was for getting so jealous, it made me really depressed and nothing good came out of it. Reddit, was I the asshole?

1yy4n3," I'm a twenty year old student who has lived away from home for the past three and a half years. I'm taking a semester off and spending a month and a half of it at my parents house. This is the longest time that I have spent at their house in the past three and a half years for a slew of reasons. I usually only come home for a few days around holidays and then ship off back to school. I did not want to spend this much time at home, my parents basically bribed me back by paying my rent and bills for the month of February and March. I'm not trying to sound ungrateful or unappreciative, I really appreciate their help, but I have been completely financially independent for the past three years and that is the way that I like it. I don't mind providing for myself and being responsible for myself financially, I actually prefer it because I don't feel obligated to other people. However, my parents were extremely adamant about me spending some time at home over my break. They don't fully understand my reasonings for taking this semester off and think that it's because I am unstable or something, which is untrue I simply needed a break like many students. Anyways, I've been here and been absolutely miserable. I hate the job that I'm working here and absolutely prefer the one at school. I don't have many friends here so I've been incredibly bored. Lastly, I have been fighting nonstop with my parents and just don't get along with my dad at all. Every conversation we have blows up into an unproportional argument involving tons of shit from the past and I end up saying really terrible things and feeling like a piece of shit. I try to avoid anything other than meaningless remarks about the t.v. show we're watching or how food tastes so this doesn't happen because I feel terrible constantly arguing with him when I'm in his home and he's paying for all of my stuff. But he keeps prying at things and me until I ultimately end up saying things that I really regret and feeling like an ungrateful piece of shit.

1yy70j,"Okay; so I'm going to start with the fact that I am a relatively young redditor (15) and this took place a year ago. We were sitting during lunch and this chick we use to hang out would usually give him her leftovers. So this day I asked her prior if I could have her leftovers, and she said ok. When I reminded her he was like ""dude what the fuck I asked her first"" and I told him how I asked prior and she gave me the leftovers. He flipped out and did this huge rant on how I'm a ""huge liar"" and how I lie so much (which wasn't true by the way, I pretty much only lied like a little kid normally would in 2nd grade.) and I think it was only to make me look bad; he left and moved as far away as possible.

A couple years ago my 19-year-old son got a new gf.  After I met her, I told my son (let's call him Tyler) that I thought Katie* was really sweet and smart and looked like she liked to eat.  Ok, I know that sounds bad, but Tyler's previous gf Dakota was borderline and refused to eat in front of anyone, and it always bothered me. I mean, if Tyler invites you over for a holiday meal, at least sit at the table and play with your food.  I guarantee no one would notice, but they will notice you sitting on the couch sulking.

But I digress, and I had to, to make the rest make sense.  About a year later, Tyler and Katie were hanging out here and he tells her what I said.  She looked kind of upset, and I know she thought I was making a comment about her weight, but I swear I wasn't.  I explained the whole Dakota situation, which she should've understood because she knew her and hated her with a passion.  I apologized, and explained what I meant.  I thought we were good.

Cut to **three** months later.  I'm at work and get a text from Katie's mom:  ""You're a fucking bully!  How dare you talk to an 18-year-old child like that.  You told my daughter she was a fat pig!""

What?  She texts back:  ""You're a sad pathetic cunt picking on a child.""  This goes on and on.  I mean, I thought we were friends.  This literally came out of fucking nowhere!

I tried to explain that I love to cook, and I love when people come over and they like to eat.  I really don't give a shit that the girl weighed 200 pounds.  Whatever.  My son loved her, so I loved her.

So am I an asshole for saying a girl looks like she likes to eat?

A different person comes on the speaker and asks me to repeat my order. I do so, reiterating no sauce on the burger a third time. I am told to pull to the window.

I pay the man and am handed my lemonade. Turns out the cup was overfilled and I spill quite a bit on my lap just moving the cup to my cup-holder. I turn to ask for some napkins and the guy is gone from the window. I wait for 5 minutes (I kept track because I was upset) until he returns with my bag of food.

I explain, firmly but politely, that my drink was overflowing and I need some napkins, *now* , and he should be more careful in the future.

I could stand some noise here and there, people talking around me, etc. But I cannot stand sharp noises like knocking on wood out coughing. I can tolerate it for a few minutes but when it's a constant thing throughout the day I it asks me so much.

My roommate does these type of noises constantly. He bands his fingers against a wooden bed frame all day. And he coughs every 10 minutes which makes me want to pull my hair out. It is a dry cough but he choughs with his mouth completely open without covering his mouth or trying to make it less noisy.

1yztv6,"A couple years back, I had a massive fight with a very close friend. The friendship ended with lots of (metaphorical) bloodshed, though in my defense, I was a high school freshman and afraid of having a direct confrontation. 

Basically, me and this chick M had been total best friends for about a year after I had moved to a new school. She was the first friend I made and being the insecure eighth-grader I had been I latched onto her like a cross between a leech and a member of a cult dedicated to her worship. 

In the beginning, at least, she had been pretty much an ordinary best friend. She liked to draw, when we hung out around the school afterschool doing homework, she'd usually end up doodling something. She would always make a big game out of me not being able to see it until it's done (which was basically never since she's way too lazy to finish drawings), so I made a big game out of finding ways to dramatically steal it. It was like an inside joke between us.

Our friendship was fine, until she slowly became obsessed with the idea of internet fame (mostly through her drawings or possibly her modeling). She made a bunch of internet friends through tumblr and would constantly be tweeting them and talking about them. She tried to make an effort to have me get to know them, though it felt more like showing her internet friends her irl groupies than trying to include me in her new group of friends.

We would still hang out, but she started expecting me to be constantly showering her with praise (which I had happily done without being asked in the past), but in return she would endlessly belittle me. 

Here's a conversation that I still vividly remember. The context is she was compiling info on a bunch of our friends in order to draw fanart of us in a Victoria's Secret alternate universe.

M: Wow, your waist is (i don't remember the number) centimeters, that's twice as much as mine!

me: Yeah, well my bigger boobs came at a price. (she's flat as a board and skinny as a toothpick)

M: Yeah, well Behati only has 34B, so maybe yours are too big. Oh that reminds me in the VSAU, you obviously can't be a model. I think you'd make a good casting director though.

In this Victoria's Secret fantasy of hers she was/is dating Adam Levine and is a Victoria's Secret Angel. As a direct result of her pipe dream relationship with Adam, she banned me from being a fan of Adam and said that I could like James Valentine, the guitarist from the same band. She also ""claimed"" Sherlock from BBC Sherlock and several other guys that she considered hot. 

Basically, the rest of the group of friends and I were getting tired of her shit. We all were starting to realize what a bitch she was being a lot of the time and some of us (me being the strongest advocate) wanted to just cut ties. I was definitely the person that was closest to her, so they all pretty much accepted that I knew her best. But none of us wanted to have to confront her.

What ended up happening is that she realized that I was mad at her because I had been talking to her much less. Her first instinct was to get closer with the others, but because of the horror stories I told them they didn't want to be the next person she took out her insecurities on. She then started ignoring us back. The whole while this was going on we all still hanging out like normal in school, though not outside of school.

After about a week of ignoring us she just stopped sitting with us. We were all grateful and went back to normal really quickly, even laughing at how the only people that came to her birthday party other than her family was her dad's employee's daughter.

Meanwhile, she was asking mutual friends what she had done wrong and why we'd been mad at her in the first place. She genuinely had no idea what she had done wrong. I still feel really bad about what I did to her, even though she quickly found another group of friends for hanging out with during school and she still had her internet friends.

1z02r7,"So this happened a while ago actually, but I've always wanted to know, from an objective viewpoint... Am I the asshole or were they?

Ok, so, I've lived with the same five people for three years now. In the second year, I and one of the guys I was living with got together. Let's call him John. So me and John got together in the second year of us all being together, that was all great.

Come September, all five of us move out of that house and into another. However, this house has slightly smaller bedrooms, and out of five, only two have double beds.

This is where I begin to wonder who is being the asshole. One of our housemates took one of the three single rooms, fair play. But the other two, (both single, don't ever bring anyone back on a night out, basically only ever sleep alone in their beds) decide they want the double rooms.

This pissed me off a bit because, if I was living with a couple and there were limited single beds, it wouldn't even be a question for me- one of them should have a double bed. Because they naturally will share a bed every night. What couple wants to go to seperate single beds every night?

So long story short-ish, we ended up drawing names out of a hat, and lo and behold, the two single people get the double bedrooms. I hoped someone would be big enough to offer me or John one, but no.

So me and John now share one tiny bedroom which we ended up putting two mattresses on the floor and sleeping on that.

So, sorry it's so long but... Am I the asshole for thinking myself or John should have gotten a double bedroom, or are they for being selfish?

**tldr: housemates took the only two double bedrooms in the house even though they're single leaving me and my boyfriend to have two tiny single bedrooms.**

Basically, I was at a John Mayer concert, in a pretty good seat but off to the side (not in the pit, which is relevant). When JM came out, he was playing a really rockin' tune, so I stood up and started jamming out. I would say ~90% of the people in the arena were standing for this, but my section was a disproportionately sitting one. I was really the only one in the immediate area standing. I would stand and sit intermittently as the songs went on based on the dance-factor of the song and how much I liked it.

At one point while I was standing up, two women about four rows behind me started throwing popcorn at me and yelling at me to sit down. I got really embarrassed and sat, but after a few minutes I was upset with how they had handled it, so a few songs later, I stood back up (with the help of my girlfriend and a few other people around us who had scene the exchange). By this point a few other isolated people/couples had done the same for a couple songs at a time. My ""petty revenge"" was subtly encouraging people around me to stand up, helping create a majority so that a.) it would be fine for me to stand and b.) the women would have a harder time telling 20 people to sit down.

To be fair, I was a lot meaner in the telling in /r/pettyrevenge, so [here is the link](http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1y9dny/standing_up_for_my_right_to_stand_up/) if you'd like to read it and the ensuing comments. I just kind of assumed people would be on my side, as you can tell by my whiny edit at the top. 

Am I the asshole? I want to believe I'm not, mostly because I think throwing popcorn at someone is incredibly rude, at which point I didn't care, and I would have responded much more sympathetically to a more gentle approach. Other people felt that I was not entitled to any courtesies because I started the asshole train by standing in the first place, and honestly I understand that too, which is why I sat down in the first place. I didn't want to be rude and block views. But I also believed that I wasn't in the wrong to stand given the nature of the act--he's got some jams and is very encouraging of light dancing. Still, for people that just wanted to sit down and enjoy the show, I was definitely hurting the experience. Please let me know what you think.

1zb4s5,"A few years ago I attended a science camp due to my parents wishes. I made the best of it, and made some friends, one of which happened to be vegetarian. He never pushed his views on anyone and was a very funny and friendly person. He was a cool dude. 

At any rate, one day in one of the camp ""classes"" we were using iPads to talk about dinosaurs. The lesson ended short, so the instructor gave us permission to look up videos on YouTube for the remainder of class (only a couple of minutes). We were partners, and just kind of looked at each other with no idea what to watch. I asked him if he wanted to watch something, and he said he didn't care, and I didn't know what to bring up on such short notice, but then something came to me.

Previous to my attendance at the camp, a friend showed me [this odd video](http://youtu.be/NyieI2bxyIk) about spiral cutting hot dogs. Forgetting this kid was vegetarian, I brought it up and had him watch it, eager to see his reaction. He was rather indifferent, and it was only later I remembered he was a vegetarian.

When I realized that, it was already too late to apologize to him as camp was over, but I still felt kind of bad about it for some reason, despite him never mentioning the incident.

1zcmbw,"Met this guy at a social gathering and became close friends with him quickly. We talk everyday and hang out a on average 2-3 times a week. We started hugging more often, then cuddling during movies/t.v at my place and one night after one too many beers we start making out and have sex twice that night, he ends up sleeping in my bed and the next morning I discuss it with him. 

We both decided it would be best if it didn't happen again, that neither of us regret the action and that we shouldn't tell his boyfriend about it. That we should try to go back to how things were. That works for a little while until one evening we end up sleeping together again. This time we talk a little more in depth about it, I tell him I like him a lot and he tells me that he thinks I'm cute and funny but that he's confused about his feelings toward me and that he's not the best at figuring his feelings out. He did say he knows that he's not ready to give up on his relationship yet and that it wouldn't be fair to me or him if I waited around for him. 

Despite being hurt by his words, he was very gentle about it and stressed that he would hate it if this ruined our friendship.

So now we're back to being friends, we still talk pretty frequently and hang out every week. Basically, everything is nearly identical to how things were prior to having sex. The only issue is that I still have these feelings and I'm trying to get over them. I don't want to change anything between us because I think that would hurt too much. 

**tl;dr My personal life has become a Taylor Swift song and it sucks**

*Side Note: He confided in me after a month of being friends about his relationship problems and I learned that the boyfriend has a history of mental ailments (the BF claims to have Dissociative Identity Disorder) and neglected him for 7 months and cheated on him (my friend saw messages from other guys that are very incriminating). Point is, there's clearly a lot of latent animosity and it's all become unhealthy but he's trying to still ""make it work.""*

203osl,"This happened in october.
I'm (used to be) active on Twitter. I have friends who're also on twitter and follow the same people as I do. Next saturday there would be a twitter meetup, in a student village and the plan was to go out. I planned to go with that (girl) friend of mine and asked to borrow the car from my parents since I didn't feel like hanging out all night with these people. (They have met lots of time and 80% of their friends are actually from twitter).

The monday of that week, I went to TED and thanks to Foursquare I discovered that there were some 'tweeps' over there there too, I talked to them for 5 minutes and he told me to come to the meeting.

Later that week, another girl (let's call her Crazy Bitch or CB) had some free tickets to the avant-premiรจre of Thor 2 in a movieplex nearby, I replied and went over there to meet her and watch the movie. It was fun and asked if she came to the meetup aswell. She did and I told her she could come along with us since I have 4 places in the car and appearantly we live nearby. We ran into each other at school, even tough I had never seen her there before.
Friday evening was halloween night, so I was still tired saturday.

That saturday it was the infamous meetup. A mutual friend of me and my friend wanted to go out, since we were going to that meeting we told him he could join us, even tough he's not active on Twitter. CP let us know she and a friend were coming over soon, what? a friend? who invited her? You can't assume I have enough place to accomodate everyone. Because of that our mutual friend couldn't join, but that was no big deal.
I had to be home at 2 AM and felt like it would be late enough already around these people. So we're drinking and talking at different bars. Around quarter over 1 I tell CB that we're about to leave since we have to get the car and it's still a half hour drive. She tells us she's going to greet everyone. After 30 minutes waiting outside and talking to others, we get in to look for her. She was still talking and didn't feel pressured at all. We told everyone goodbye within 2 minutes and left.

While walking to the car, CB's friend really had to pee. Are you fucking kidding me? We've been at bars ALL NIGHT! She's theatening to wet the car if she can't find a toilet. OMG, I'm mad and get the car meanwhile, while complaining to my friend. We leave the village at 2 AM.

As I'm on the highway and realize it's still 20 minutes till my friends home I ask them if it's fine to drop them there aswell, they can now call a taxi if they like. Withing the captial regeon, Taxi's are quite cheap. But the capital is also concidered dangerous, especially if you live in another city.. Which is totally exaggerated, especailly at 3 AM at the first exit of the highway. As we arrive the taxi's already waiting, and called to ask where they are. The friend asks if I needed money for the petrol. My parents pay it, so I don't mind, but since I was outraged I asked โฌ10. All good I think and drive home, 10 minutes later I get in bed, 1 hour later than expected. (Besides, โฌ10 is the student wage for one hour work, which is a perfect compensation. Also, the car is around โฌ50k, devided by 200k km, multiplied by the traveled distance is also โฌ10, so it's still justifiable)

So the next day there was a huge discussion on Twitter, I didn't notice until someone asked me about it in a Direct Message. I had no idea what this was all about and decided to ask CB, to my astonishment she blocked me. What? Well appearantly I dropped 2 young girls in the middle of the capital, a VERY dangerous city and they were unsafe. I am amazed, most people don't care or don't see what this was all about, some girls think I'm the devil, but I don't mind.",AItA for dropping two girls in the middle of a dangerous place?,[deleted],1,1394502634,7
205zhr,"A few weeks ago, I got into a somewhat nasty argument with my friends.

It was about something stupid, they were copying code for an assignment, which I was against, and I told them that they shouldn't. I'm mildly mentally ill, and I was having a really bad day so I was in a particularly bad mood and I said some really nasty things to one friend in particular.
 
Not threatening or scary or anything, but I insulted her. I called her stupid, I told her the only reason she got this far was because she cheated in every class (which she did to an extent, but so does everyone), but I was a huge asshole about it and I felt horrible immediately after and I texted her to apologize.

We hung out for the next few days and she seemed fine with me, but I still felt bad about how much of an asshole I was and I decided to come clean and tell her about me being mentally ill. 

She responded with ""That's really scary"" and then completely stopped talking to me. She wouldn't respond to anything I said after that, even when I asked her about unrelated things like classes.

When I told her, I told her that I really didn't want anyone to know but I'd understand if she felt like she had to tell anyone, but she never responded to me again after that.

Later, I was talking to another friend about how frustrated I was with that and decided to tell him too, he told me that she had actually told him about that the week before, and that she had showed him my texts.

I texted her again, begging her not to tell any more people.

 I knew I couldn't reasonably be mad at her for telling him but I told him that it was ok.

I knew I was putting the burden of a big secret on her, that's why I said it was ok if she felt like she had to talk to someone about that, just like I felt like I needed to talk to someone about this. But I just wished she would talk to me, to at least respond to me or tell me to stop bothering her about it.

 He told me that whenever drama happens she just ignores the person that's a part of it, ie: what was going on and she was just trying to enjoy her spring break.

I started getting really angry at this point, and talking about how selfish she was, he started getting offended too, saying that I can't say anything bad about her for that and that they were best friends (I happen to know that she used to complain about him a lot too, before he got extremely good at a class they're taking together and he started helping her).

He insisted that she wouldn't have told anymore people (even though I already know she told him), and also got offended that I implied that she would and said that I was the asshole and that this was the reason she didn't consider us friends anymore.

Maybe I'm just having a hard time looking at this objectively, maybe I haven't presented it objectively, and maybe I'm just too batshit crazy to think about it objectively, but I'm starting to feel like all the people I know are terrible people.

I'm willing to admit that I never should have told her, that this was way too much to put on someone that didn't consider me a close friend, but I also can't help but feel that just completely abandoning that person and then talking about them and not even offering them the piece of mind that an ""ok"" could give makes you an atleast somewhat selfish person, and that I'm not in the wrong for getting angry at that.",AMITA for telling my friend something private?,[deleted],4,1394568437,7

So I call a taxi to take me home and he asks me if I want him to stay with me. I say no its absolutely fine go get booze with your mates. He offered a  couple of times and I said I'm absolutely fine just go. So he did. 

Then as I was stood alone in the street waiting for my taxi I realised I actually thought it was really shitty of him to leave me like that. And I know, I fucking SAID it was fine. I did. And that's why I think I'm the asshole. But.... A part of me just got annoyed he would actually leave me like that alone at night on the street.

a while ago I bought a water filter that is used for hiking or other outdoor activities. Its purpose is to make dirty or contaminated water drinkable. The filter I bought was from a very well respected manufacturer (Katadyn if anyone is interested) but this specific model had some major design flaws. I sent in my filter because it had failed after a short time and got a brand new unit in return. Because I didn't really trust this filter anymore, I got one from a different brand and sold the exchanged one on a small trekking forum. That was years ago and I kind of forgot all about it. Until I stumbled upon a travel report where someone has trouble with his water filter and eventually he and his friend become sick and have to cancel their trip. He wrote that he bought the filter on the forums, so I checked and it was in fact the filter that I had sold to him...

So now I feel like an asshole because I knew the filter was shit and I still sold it. On the other hand, it was a brand new unit from a respected manufacturer that is still sold at most commercial outdoor stores.

20siao,"Recently I spent a good amount of time traveling around New Zealand. I had a tiny budget, so I was getting around by hitch hiking and sleeping in my tent most nights. One afternoon I was picked up by a friendly older Kiwi. It turned out his business is consulting for struggling hostels, so he very frequently meets travelers like me and picks up hitch hikers. He has traveled the country dozens of times. On the way to my destination he went out of his way to take me to some cool thermal pools and pretty sights. It was great, because I likely would have just passed straight by them if anybody else had picked me up. 

He was going on a speaking tour over the next week. Shortly before arriving at my destination he said, ""It's too bad your not going to this other way with me next instead. I could show you this spot and that. And I could get you free accomodation in these towns."" Since he had been so friendly, and because I wanted to be open to fun new experiences and people, I decided spur of the moment to change my plan and keep traveling with him instead. 

I stay in his hotel room with him that night. He got us both dinner with the food budget he had from his employer. He then suggested we buy some alcohol, and asks if I don't mind paying since he got dinner. I had planned on giving up drinking at this point in my trip to save money, but I was happy to since he was being so nice and helpful to me. I bought a couple bottles of wine that got polished off pretty fast. And he ended up sharing a lot of whiskey that he had brought, so he was definitely giving back more than he was asking. We probably stayed up till 2 in the morning drinking, and had some great conversation.

The next day we move on to the next city, and basically repeat the night before. I buy a couple bottles of wine, and he very insistently makes me take a couple whiskey shots. At this point his personality is really starting to grate on me, but I figure it would be rude to leave early when he is expecting me to keep traveling with him for a couple more days.

Day 3, while we're driving he straight up calls me out for not being appreciative enough of him. In particular, he said that I should be making more of an effort to buy food or drinks. He was mad at me that he had to ask me to buy the wine, and that I wasn't pushing to do so myself. His reasoning is that I should be spending whatever money I am saving by not staying in a hostel on things that we can enjoy. He frequently hosts couch surfers, and says that is standard practice when somebody provides you with a place to stay. But I actually spent more money traveling with him than I would have without. And it seemed unfair to expect we should each contribute equally, because I had almost no money and he had kept bragging about how much money he was making from each of his speaking engagements. This pretty much spelled the end of traveling together for me, and I hitched another ride while he was in one of his speaking engagements. He never responded to my message when I told him what I was doing. 

Ever since I've been worrying about this general situation. I'm very stingy with what I allow myself to buy. So I'm also not usually buying stuff that I share with other people.

&gt;&gt;Victim-blaming has no place in an institution as influential as school.

&gt;Knowingly letting your nine year-old wear cartoon backpacks that are almost guaranteed to make other kids shit on him is pretty asinine.

I realized at this point that I may have come across as overbearing, so replied trying to clear it up: 

&gt;&gt;&gt;That's a backward logic that should have no place in school.

&gt;&gt;When have public schools ever anything operate on anything but backwards logic?

&gt;Many times? Institutions which were influenced by feminist and womens rights groups dared to incorporate into their policy that women should be allowed to wear typically male clothing. 

&gt;&gt;A few decades ago women were thoroughly shamed for wearing pants

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, the my little pony backpack is total analogous to women not being allowed to wear pants.*Totally.*

&gt;The logic used in both scenarios is most definitely comparable. I am by no means trying to compare the severity of both situations. 



&gt;&gt;f you were alive then and a woman being bullied was told to stop wearing pants, would you sympathize with the school's actions? 

&gt;&gt;&gt;You should probably tell me I'd tell blacks to get to the back of the bus too, drama queen.

&gt;..Woah there, did I hit a bone with you? Never did I accuse you personally of anything, and if you read that as so, I am telling you now that I wrote that comment without any emotion directed toward you. If you have a problem with my comment, direct it to my words and not me personally. If you wish to continue to make this personal, then I have no interest in this conversation. 

&gt;&gt;It's a horrible idea and should be treated as such.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Letting your son wear a My Little Pony backpack to school? Yes, I totally agree.

&gt;In many schools, no bullying would result from this. Sometimes wearing ""goth"" clothing and makeup can get both girls and boys bullied in school, but that shouldn't force a parent to absolutely prohibit their children from wearing a certain kind of look. 

&gt;&gt;Victim-blaming has no place in an institution as influential as school.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Knowingly letting your nine year-old wear cartoon backpacks that are almost guaranteed to make other kids shit on him is pretty asinine.

&gt;As I said, there are places where no bullying would occur as a result of this. In any case, even if you do desire to put slight blame and criticism onto the mother, that is an entirely different subject. The school as a governmental entity should direct the punishing to the perpetrators. If a girl wearing a miniskirt is raped by a classmate, the classmate should be punished and not the girl. As I said, I am not comparing the severity of these situations, but the reality is that the logic used to arrive to both conclusions is similar, and both are examples of victim-blaming. We don't live in a society where people are punished for increasing their chances of being a victim, and a school which runs because of the government should follow similar principles of righteousness.

20ydkp,"So, I live in a college neighborhood. I was just leaving my apartment to go to the grocery store, and I get to a ""T"" in the road. The other car, a pretty new-looking silver Audi, is driving down the straight part. I'll admit I wasn't 100% attentive at this moment, but I also think the Audi was going a bit too fast for being in a parking lot. There was no stop sign where I was, it was a situation where I was supposed to yield. I judged that the car was far enough away that I had time to make the turn, so I did. The Audi got really close to my car while I turned and had to stop. I knew I fucked up--I was pretty embarrassed so I didn't look to see the driver's face, but I could tell out of the corner of my eye that he wasn't happy. I thought ""Oh well, at least it's over. What's the worst that could happen, he follows me?"" (Which I never thought would actually happen. When this happened, he was driving in the opposite direction from where I was headed. This means he actually made an effort to stop and turn around.)

Fast forward about five minutes. I parked at the grocery store. I was grabbing my stuff to get out of the car, and I heard a knock on the window. I was about to get out anyway, so I opened the door. It was someone I didn't recognize. He starts to say, ""Next time, learn how to drive!""

I immediately realized who it was, and I said, ""You followed me here...?!""

""Yeah, you almost did some serious damage to my car. I live at--I actually work at [apartment complex], and I just don't wanna see people around there driving like that.""

""I'm really sorry...what do you want me to say? Nothing happened. I'll admit I wasn't paying full attention. I'm really sorry. I don't know what else to say.""

At this point, I was really freaked out. I figured if this guy followed me, he was at least a little crazy...but after that he pretty much accepted my apology and went on his way. I feel like I should mention that while he got out of his car to talk to me, he left his car parked in the middle of the parking lot. The incident had me pretty shook up for the rest of the day. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and it's people like this who are the reason why I don't like to leave my apartment often. I told my roomies about it later, and we wondered, how far would he have followed me? What if I was driving to the other side of town? This happened a couple days ago, and I've been terrified of running into him again ever since. 

In my opinion, if you're so worried about your fancy car being damaged, don't bring it to a college neighborhood full of inexperienced drivers.

2111au,"So I've been friends with a certain woman who I've had intense non-reciprocal feelings for. I've known her for roughly nine months, and we became pretty close. Just within the last week or so, her hold on my psyche has been broken, and I'm speaking more freely around her now that I'm not quite so worried about what she thinks about me. It seems like all she talks about is her exes (plural) lately. It makes me extremely uncomfortable, but up until now I didn't want to say anything.

The other day we're having coffee, and it's a friendly conversation, but she starts spiraling around the same topic (her difficulties telling whether she's attracted to men as opposed to women). I tell her that she's really driving this topic into the ground, and that she's been saying the same thing over and over for ten minutes. She says that she doesn't act like an asshole when I do it (I didn't realize that I did, and I'm not sure if I do). I immediately apologize for my insensitive comment. We sit in silence for a moment, and she leaves as I sit in stunned silence asking myself what had just happened. It turned a complete 180 from friendly to hostile in a split second.

I realize that this was probably something important to her to talk about, but I don't think I realized the degree to which it was.

211phs,"Annie and Bonnie are parent and adult child, respectively. Bonnie and I have been, as the story starts out, romantically involved for less than 5 months.

I have the ability and tools to do certain jobs that Annie and Bonnie need done. Annie wants to compensate me (which I tried to dissuade her from doing, but she insisted) but Annie doesn't have the cash she thinks the work is worth. Instead, at Bonnieโs suggestion, Annie offers to trade a vehicle worth roughly what the jobs are worth. This vehicle used to belong to her deceased son (Bonnieโs brother). It had also at that time sat idle for nearly 4 years. Because I like the vehicle and have the ability to bring it back to operating order, plus want to keep Annie happy, I accept the offer.

Afterward, Annie tells me that she preferred that the vehicle not go to Bonnie after I suggested that she drive it when she wanted (Annie said she was concerned about safety, as itโs a bit top-heavy, not a hardtop, and has nothing but a basic seatbelt). I then find that Bonnie has been really wanting the vehicle anyway, even though she knew of her motherโs objections. At this point I begin to suspect that Bonnieโs running a scheme to get the vehicle despite her motherโs wishes, but since itโs just a suspicion and otherwise weโre having a great relationship, I let it go.

I complete just about everything that Bonnie needed, plus some other things that come up incidentally. In the meantime, Iโve spent a good bit of money and time getting the vehicle back into operating order and making a few improvements. The jobs I need to do for Annie require that one or both of them be present or allow me access to out-of-town property. I complete a couple of daysโ worth and then something weird happens. Every opportunity that I have to work for Annie, Bonnie has convinced her to take a daytrip, or some other distraction, or gives me conflicting information regarding the arrangements that keeps me from being able to complete the work. Bonnie goes quiet when I ask about this phenomenon, and our relationship falters.

Despite what I feel are one-sided efforts on my part to discuss these and other issues, our relationship starts to cool at the 10-11 month mark. I make the split, finally and at the time amicably, after 14 months, with Bonnie bemoaning our โlack of communicationโ and telling me that only she knows what her mother REALLY wants/needs, and states that my understanding of Annieโs clear language is severely flawed. Due to this and other factors, some of the jobs that Annie needed done did not get done. I donโt feel comfortable contacting Annie directly and risking coming between her and her daughter (theyโre basically the only family each of them have left in the local area).

A couple of months after we split, Bonnie contacts me on Facebook, requesting that I give the vehicle to her. Due to the abusive nature of her language I do not reply, but instead block her on Facebook and from calling or texting me. I have not blocked any communication from Annie, however, but have yet to hear anything at all from her. If they can maintain a good relationship by both hating me, Iโm OK with that, even though I still regard Annie very highly.

I do not live/work/travel through the areas they are in, so itโs not likely that they will see the vehicle. Besides, I have altered itโs appearance in various ways, and I donโt feel that they would immediately recognize it if they did happen to see it. Just to throw one more factor in, it currently needs a major repair to the transmission that, according to mechanics much better than I, is likely due to the long time sitting idle.

219ccq,"  Some background first which is relevant. 

  I've always been considered the most academic of the family and so things like good grades and school performance reports weren't a negotiation, I was expected to work hard and get them. Even when I did, I was rarely given praise for it, other than a short 'well done' or 'good'. Basically I was expected to be a 'good little girl' and just do what I was told. 
  
  Then there's my cousin. He basically never tried at school and left at 16 with close to nothing to show for it. He was also, and still is to some extent, allowed to do as he pleased. He just seemed content to sit on his bum, collect his unemployment money and just generally laze his life away. Any attempt to speak with him about going to college and getting some qualifications (I wasn't the one speaking to him to clarify.) or about applying for work was met with 'dunno' or 'I'm looking at a course' or 'I'm speaking to a mate' or some other lazy excuse. 
  
  So skip forward to two weeks ago and a family member mentions that she's heard from someone she knows that there is this job going which my cousin should be 'perfect' to do. Stuff happens, calls get made and abraadabra, my cousin gets the job, no effort required on his part.

  Now part of the problem I have with the whole thing is that the same help wasn't exactly forthcoming when it came to my own jobsearching, and if anything I was made to feel quite a shitty, horrible failure of a human being by my family for it. There were times when things devolved into screaming matches (not instigated by myself for the most part) because of it. 

 Rather it was the situation that it was down to my effort, despite my family, to find jobs, to post CVs to companies, to secure interviews and then to finally secure the job I now have. All of it was because I put in real effort and actually did something. 

  Another part of me also feels resentment because I know that my cousin isn't the person my family thinks he is. They think he's this wonderful innocent kid, and that he's somehow on a pedestal because he'll do a few odd jobs for them now and again. Yet I've seen the other side of him for myself and I know he's just playing the goodie two-shoes act so he'll get the praise (and money/favours) from them.

21dsje,"There was this nice, hot girl named Megan (not her real name, but for safety) at high-school who was a little unstable. We were friends on Facebook. After graduating, she deleted her account. I deleted my account a few months later due to some unrelated issues, and then made a new one a few months later. I learned that nobody had heard from Megan in six months. As of a month ago, nobody had heard from her in almost two and a half years. I decided to Google her and found a Photobucket with some pictures of Megan in underwear and some of her in a see-through top. (No bra)

Now, I have admittedly masturbated to Megan multiple times in high-school, so I was super excited but worried that Megan had put her full name on. I saved all the pictures, made an account, and commented on one of her pictures:

""Hey Megan, this is polarbear2217 from *name of high school*. How are you doing?""

I was so excited that I shared the pictures with my friend on Facebook, and then regretted it after my hormones cooled down. 
 
She locked the album two days later. I feel better that nobody can find it, especially since the idiot put her FULL NAME on it, but I feel guilty for several reasons.

1. Googling her name. I honestly just wanted to see if her name was mentioned with regards to some college or if she had a blog. I did not expect to find her in her bra and panties.

2. I couldn't figure out a way to private message on Photobucket, but commenting one of the pictures in a blasรฉ manner doesn't seem like the best strategy.

3. I still have the photos downloaded and sometimes I still masturbate to them. I can't believe my luck that I found them (she was one of the top 3 girls in my class I wanted to see naked), but I feel like an asshole for looking at them since she closed her account when she learned that I had found it.

When I overrode his design decisions as to the design, he threw a hissy fit again and said that I could do it my way but expect no help from him.

To make a long story short, when his pass gets rejected from the scanner on the second day, it turned out that the mountain only gave him a one day pass while I got the two day that we both thought we had.  He had the receipt and they did only charge him for the one day lift ticket, so I'm assuming the ticket people just misheard him or hit the wrong button or something.  Obviously this would be a total pain in the ass for anyone, but you would have sworn it was the worst thing that had happened to him in the past year.  He threw a goddamn fit in the lift line.  Me, being a little bitch for some reason (probably too nervous about confronting a friend, especially with a 4-5 hour drive in front of us), didn't really say anything.  I kind of passively agreed with everything he was going on about as if I was only half paying attention.  I somehow got dragged in to his plan to go confront the service desk.  He did all the talking while I just kind of sheepishly sat there and presented my own lift ticket when he asked.  They didn't reimburse him.  Instead, he would have had to buy a second one day pass which would have been about $20 more total than just getting the two day pass in the first place.  In a final act of angry principal he refused to buy the ticket and starts heading to the car to leave.  I guess he expected me to go with him but seeing as how I paid full price and wanted to ride the entire second day (this was at like 10:30), I told him that I was going to stay and ride.  He ended up staying in his car (he drove us) for a few hours while I stayed on the mountain.  I did come back earlier than I would have otherwise, but I'm sure it was still boring as fuck for him.  One thing I will say though, is that he had really been being a jerk for the entire trip.  He had bitched about everything from how far the restaurant was from where we were staying, to the people we shared the lift with to how much this mountain sucked compared to the ones he normally goes to.  If he hadn't had been such a dick for the past two days I would have been willing to compromise or help him out in some way, but at this point I wasn't feeling too generous towards him.

Okay so for context, I'm a 21 year old male and my parents divorced about 3 years ago after many years of fighting. The divorce has been very ""messy"" with my parents constantly putting me and my 17 year old brother in the middle. Both my brother and I live with my mom and see my dad a few times a week. 

Both my mom and I work at a hardware store together. My dad came in yesterday, like he usually does every now and then, looking at some clearance items in flooring and decided he wanted to buy some plus order some more. I told him I'd handle it all and call him later. I was told to put his items aside in the back and called him when I left work to let him know. He said he and his girlfriend would come in later that night to make sure she liked everything my dad was planning to purchase. 

My mom was working at that time so I texted her letting her know they were coming to give her a heads up. Later my mom freaked out saying I shouldn't have brought him to the store, although he came by himself, and I shouldn't help him because of the way he treats her and she let everyone at work know that I don't live with him so if I let him use my discount I would be fired. She also threatened to not come home that night, but she eventually did really late.

We've been going back and forth all day. She thinks I should have told my dad not to bring his girlfriend in. My dad isn't a reasonable person so I don't think he'd listen, and I really dont see how I'm supposed to control what he does. I'm also upset that she blames this whole thing on me when it seems like it's a problem between them. I'm also not happy about her airing out our dirty laundry for all our employees to see and also threatening my job.

I'm sorry this is so long but if anyone has actually read all of this and would like to offer an opinion it'd be greatly appreciated. ",Stuck in the middle of my parents messy divorce,cosmic_vibes,15,1396635427,5

22jmeb,"Me and my best friend have a hard time getting together to hang out. We're both very busy in general, not to mention she works retail and I work office hours so we work a lot of opposite hours. I asked her what she was doing this Thursday or Friday evening and she said ""I'm working Thursday. I'm off Friday, but me and BF usually have plans every Friday hanging out with XYZ""

Is it crazy of me to think it's rude she isn't willing to make plans on Friday because of something that *usually* happens? I mean it isn't like she's talked to these people and they have a definite plan for *this week*. I'm sure it isn't some unspoken rule that they must get together every single Friday.

Not to mention she said they've been doing it every Friday since November and I know that's an exaggeration because we've hung out on Fridays plenty of times since November and she's told me about other things she's done on certain Fridays over the last few months when we've caught up during the week.

I guess I feel like if they haven't talked about getting together this week she should consider herself free to make other plans and it's kinda crappy that when we both have a night off she's willing to say ""no, probably not that night.

22wuuq,"This friend of mine is in a band of sorts, but doesn't have a bassist, and so when they need one, they'll usually get someone in as a session player. For this the band shell out a fair sum of money. 

  Now a few months ago, this friend of mine mentioned to me that they were recording again and asked me if I were interested in recording the bass if they needed someone. I said that it sounded a great idea and so we left it at that. At this stage he did mention to me that he'd cover the studio fee for me and that he'd pay me whatever my rate was for the work. 
 
  Two weeks ago, he emailed me telling me that he'd written this song, which needed a bassist because it was a slap-bass line and he wanted a real bass sound and not a computer playing it. I agreed to do a rough draft recording for him for nothing, as he's a good friend and I thought that with even a really rough recording he would at least be able to get a demo version done and find someone to play it in the studio for the proper version. So I recorded it for him on my own time, sent it to him and thought nothing more about it. 

 Last week he contacted me to tell me they were hitting the studio with the song and asked me if I was interested in doing the session with them playing bass again, this time for real. We discussed the details and I could make the studio date and time and so on. Then I asked him about the money we'd talked about before, and this is when things took a turn. He told me that he'd agreed to pay my studio fee, but that he was hoping that I'd do it for them pretty much 'as a friend' (his words, not mine, meaning he wanted a freebie) because I'd done the draft recording for nothing. I told him that if he wasn't willing to pay me as promised, then not only was I not doing the studio session, but that I wasn't willing to let him use my draft recording either.

22zbok,"I'll try to be brief, but it isn't my strong suit. I've worked at the same company for over 5 years as the database reporting guru. Six months ago, we hired on half a dozen new guys to build out Business Intelligence processes. They have not grown on me. I perceive them to be cliquish and always having meetings where nothing gets accomplished. I am more about production and building solid relationships with the business units.

The topic at hand is a payroll report that I have spent the past five years on, changing it as the business needs it. I have resisted delegating it to my own team because it's such a business-critical thing. Over the past week, the new guys started working on a payroll report. Their manager (who is mine, too) said they were doing it for a different group that I'm not involved in. Until last night, when he tells me they have finished the payroll report that will replace mine, with very little collaboration from me.

I want to swear at him, tell him to go to hell, and complain about going behind my back. I've looked at their code, and it's missing a lot of important pieces that are in mine. As a bonus, they discovered a way around a broken data source that will let me improve mine. 

It infuriates me. I don't want to come across as a diva and say it has to be done my way or no way, but I really think this was the wrong approach on their part. I *AM* the expert on what Payroll wants, so if they wanted to help, it should have been more collaborative. I feel that I left myself open for questions and discussions.

23qnga,"So I met this girl online last night and suggested we go out for coffee sometime. We kept talking and she suggested we skip coffee and just go back to her place and have sex. Like any man, I was perfectly okay with this.

Anywho, after we ""bumped uglies"", we started talking about what we want to make out of this. I said I'm up for anything, but I'd rather be in a relationship as opposed to just being FWB (it was a weak moment and obviously I wasn't in complete focus after fucking her five minutes before). She seemed insulted by my wishy-washy answer, but I just ignored it and moved along.

So after I kiss her goodbye and all that, I'm heading home and I realize I just spent at least five bucks in gas, and took about 3 and a half hours out of my day seeing this girl. I came to the conclusion during the long drive home (45mins) that there's no way I can keep a serious relationship going when I have to take a whole day to go see her (btw, I'm the only one who drives, and I don't have a ton of extra money for gas, or a girlfriend right now).

I told her how I felt about this a couple hours ago and she just went crazy hostile towards me, telling me how I ""used her to get what I want and now that I'm done I'll just ignore her forever and hope she goes away"". I tried to have an adult discussion with her and instead she decided to attack me, making me all in all pretty shitty about myself.

My new girlfiend of six months doesn't like that we've remained in contact with each other.  She feels threatened and she thinks of this communication as cheating our relationship.  She wants me to stop talking with my ex and has said that we (my new gf and I) will have to break up if I don't.  

To me, it seems like an unfair demand.  I wouldn't tolerate it regarding family, I wouldn't tolerate it regarding other close friends.  I love my new girlfriend, but I don't think she should be allowed to force decisions like this in our relationship.
