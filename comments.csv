1yu29c,cfnrjzr,"Yep.  You're the asshole.  If you want to make the commitment to work hard on improving your health and your diet, then that is your job.  If those who live with you want to support you by changing their lifestyle, too, that would be fabulous. But, it's not for you to dictate to them, or to throw away their property.   

If you felt that throwing the donuts away is going to help your parents, I can tell you that is very unlikely, because:  (A) Making one snack inconvenient is not going to change a lifelong eating pattern, and (B) Losing weight is a personal choice one has to commit to oneself.  In most cases, having your self-righteous kid start preaching to you like he's smarter than you and knows better is really unlikely to motivate you in the right direction.

Have a talk with your parents.  Tell them what this means to you and *ask* if they want to support you and try to live healthier themselves.  If they say ""no"", do it yourself and lead by example, but don't throw out their stuff.

I'm gonna go ahead and disagree with the majority and say that they're the assholes (you maybe a bit too, but...).

I'll first make the assumption that you're obese as a result of growing up in a household of food addicts. They passed their addiction on to you.

Would I say I completely understand the response of throwing away said alcohol? Yes.

It may well be that they don't understand that their habits affect you too. It may benefit all of you to have a conversation about that. ""Mom, because you won't try and quit this, you're not only killing yourself but also killing me."" Statements like that might just be jarring enough to shift someone from contemplating change to actually wanting to do it.

1yugsc,cfnwbh1,"The point is that your coworker has some concept in mind of what she thinks a musical is (perhaps, simply what she likes in a musical), and *Les Mis* doesn't fit into that.  As an example, I was big Star Trek fan during the Original Series and the Next Generation.  I was drawn to it's high-concept, episodic, old-fahioned Science-fiction structure that explored and extrapolated the consequences of technological possibilities on societies.  I stopped watching in the era of DS9 and Voyager, because they started to focus on established characters and series-long developing plots about war and began to feel a hell of a lot more like every other 1 hour drama on TV.   I referred to these two shows as a ""soap opera in space"" because I thought it succinctly defined how I think they departed from the framework I had come to expect from Trek.  I know they literally weren't soap operas; they weren't daytime, daily shows targeted at home-makers...but I think my point was valid.

Your co-worker is doing the same thing.  She probably likes the idea that musicals are normal plays with periodic musical set-pieces that add spectacle and emphasis to important parts of the drama.  She probably gravitates toward, amusing, cheerful, or sarcastic plays, and dislikes anything that falls out of those categories.  So when she says ""it's opera"", she's really probably referring to all the things he doesn't like about her concept of opera, and pointing out that *Les Mis* is too much like those things for her to enjoy.

So that's your first mistake (not phrasing it in a way that would be more palatable to the Girlfriend, or her hyper-sensitive BF).   This isn't an asshole move, just a mistake.   

So now we look at your friend's actions: he told the GF that you think she's a bitch.  Really can't hold it against him, given the assumption above; you should have known it would get to her.   Next, he wants you to apologize for ""making her feel bad"".  Now, this is where your friend starts to look more than a bit pussy-whipped.   You didn't make her feel bad; you told your friend the truth.  He is the one who told it to her.  So, if hearing the truth can be blamed on ""making her feel bad"", he's the one who should be sorry.  But really, what makes her feel bad is that she is not well liked, and the blame for that is on her.  Making you apologize is never going to help with that problem, so it's kind a stupid thing to ask.  There's at least one mistake on his part. 

So, here we are at one mistake on each side, and the all-to-common scenario of not liking your buddy's girl.  If you want to keep your buddy, and you think he's going to stick with her for good, you've got to swallow your pride and give her the BS apology and try extra hard to find a way to get along with her.  (Since the truth makes her sad, she's basically asking to be treated like a fragile egg, not an adult.)   As long as the relationship lasts, she's going to be the ultimate winner with your bud.  If you don't want to kowtow to her, your other choices are to gamble that they'll break up soon or decide that you just don't think he's worth the trouble of putting up with her.  In either of those cases, tell him to grow some balls and leave her at home or go screw and leave you alone.

You are justified in wanting to support your mother in an emotionally difficult time. *Especially* when she has expressed being scared and needing support. Chemo isn't a walk in the park, as I have experienced myself. And family is an important life-line in existential crises. So you are *not* the asshole for putting your mom first.

You however *are* an asshole for avoiding to talk to your wife about your plans, when you have known all along that your decision to support your mother will mean you won't be there for that wedding (if your wife chose the passive-aggressive approach to bring the topic up by asking you about your suite, that also isn't ideal btw. If she really didn't *know* - that makes you look pretty bad.) And you also *are* an asshole for not owning up to the fact that -yes- you are not looking forward to going to that wedding.

I was once in a similar situation with an ex of mine. From what I read, the problem isn't necessarily wedding vs. chemo, but you looking like a cop-out in her eyes, trying to use your mother's ""cancer card"" to wiggle yourself out of that one, and not being upright about it. Your wife is angry because she can smell something is fishy, and you don't admit it. Serious red flag in a relationship.

So rather than asking the internet for ""who's the asshole"", you should sit down with your wife and let her in on your worries about your mother, but also being honest that you weren't looking forward to the wedding and suggesting a plan, how you will make up for your absence at the wedding to her AND her family. Because she is going to need to defend your sorry ass against her family, when she'll attend that wedding alone. That ain't easy either.

EDIT: suggestion - invite your cousin-in-law and partner formally to a fancy dinner/night-out when you excuse yourself for not being able to attend their wedding beforehand, as they are in town anyways.

I my opinion, if there is a standing room area and you have a seat in or near the front row of seats and you *initiate* the stand up, you are an asshole.  It requires everyone behind you to stand  and screws over anyone behind you who is shorter than you.  It's also inconsiderate of people who have difficulty standing for long periods of time, i.e. people who avoid standing sections/pits. If dancing/standing is your priority, there is no reason to sit in the front row of seats.

Now if most of the people in your section are already standing, then it's fine.

Some might argue that you chose to pay for a seat so you had a good view, could sit when you wanted, and could stand/dance when you wanted. The thing is, not considering how your choices and behavior impact those around you is assholish.

As for your situation, it's possible you were an asshole or assholish. The other girls became *the* asshole when they threw popcorn instead of (or before) asking you to sit down. After that, it makes sense that you'd want to enact pretty revenge.  

However, you also screwed over everyone else behind you in getting your revenge.  You punished a whole bunch of people because you were insulted, albeit unreasonably, for something that may have been kind of dickish.

What if they posted their popcorn-throwing story in /r/pettyrevenge?

Okay, throwing popcorn IS rude.  The fact that you were rude first doesn't excuse their behavior, but it did provoke it.

Really, the venue should have standing and sitting sections, so people who prefer to sit (in their seats, which is what they purchased) can do so.

If you have 100 people standing, it doesn't mean 100 people prefer to stand.  You just need a few selfish assholes deciding to stand and fuck everyone else, and then everyone else HAS to stand (or else just stair at the butt of the person in front).

So maybe 20 people want to stand and 80 people are like ""I better stand up, I can't see shit.""

Since the venue has seats, since they are assigned, since people buy seats, sitting is the default behavior, the presumption.

If you choose to stand, you are forcing those behind you to change what they're doing, whether they want to or not.  That's just selfish, and being selfish is what makes an asshole an asshole.

THEN AGAIN, I don't ever go to concerts where people DO stand, so maybe I'm wrong.  If all the people at THAT concert had *prior knowledge* that standing was a normal, accepted thing, and went anyway, then they can't really complain.

But I've never bought a seat at any performance where that was known to me, and I would not, so if someone stood in front of me, they would absolutely be an asshole.

I do think the venue though needs to either enforce sitting, or make it CLEAR to ticket-buyers they are in a potentially standing-only situation.

Perhaps before all this **bold** would have moved back with *italics* but starting on the track of living this dream that had previously lived only in **bold's** heart has birthed a powerful a resolve to finish it. *Italics* moves back to the town and **bold** stays in the city.

You aren't going to scare me, nor are you going to scare the majority of ethical vegetarians (nearly all of whom used to eat meat at some point). I don't choose to abstain from meat because I'm not a fan of the taste.

You will look back at the good times you had with someone who was only trying to fit in and thought he'd found a good friend in you, only to discover that friendship was so easily disposed of when someone higher up comes along.

.5 After any near miss with cars, always just give a wave as in ""hey man, my bad"" you would be amazed how quickly that can diffuse the situation.

1. I know you would never expect someone to follow you over something so trivial, this is a mistake, you should always assume someone is going to react in the worst way possible following any event. 

2. After a close call like this, always check to see if you are being followed, I know you thought it was a minor thing, but that other guy didn't and his reaction shows so much. Always check your mirrors to make sure you are not being followed, this is really personal security 101 and good situational awareness. 

3.  If you notice that you think you might be being followed, make four turns in the same direction, you can chalk one or two up to coincidence, but four means they just followed you in a circle so there is only one reason why, they are following you. Only make these turns if you know the area so you don't get caught on a dead end street. NEVER go to your destination, especially if it is a residence. If you make the four turns and are being followed then drive directly to the nearest police station and then call 911. If you do not know where the nearest police station is, call 911 and tell them what is going on. 

3. If someone knocks on your window make sure your doors are locked and only crack the window as much as you need 1/2""-1"" small enough that a hand couldn't fit through the window but you can still talk. 

4. Never open your door if this happens. You are at a severe disadvantage trying to get out of your car if you have to defense yourself. 

5. Be ready to call 911, in fact, as soon as he knocked on the window you should have had your phone queued up to dial

6. Once you realize your apology isn't working, flee. Roll your window up and be ready to call 911. If the person doesn't have you blocked in, leave the scene immediately and work on getting to a police station or making sure you are not being followed (see #2)

7. If the person tries to block you in, do not hit them, but immediately call 911 and keep your doors locked and windows shut. 

8. If you immediately notice a person blocks you in after something like this happens and they come up to your window, crack it, tell them you calling 911, roll it back up and call. If they drive away, try to get the plate number. 

I know that is a lot of take in but it could save your bacon sometime. Just practice while you drive and it will become second nature.

I am one of those people who is very uncomfortable asking for help from anyone, and I feel a lot of responsibility to help people I live and work with (even if it's not my job).  So, I am constantly being approached by people who want something from me.  And I am usually surprised how entitled people with their hand out feel.  Forget whether or not they are entitled to a favor...people asking me for a favor seem to assume they're going to get what they want out of me AND they assume I owe them the effort of making them feel good for asking.  If I'm in the middle of something complicated and the interruption is a real problem, people coming to me looking for favors get offended when I'm momentarily distracted and they can tell it's a bad time.  Most people feel like it's my job to act happy that I'm being interrupted and  be thankful for the chance to drop what I'm doing on the alter of their current whim.  Where does this attitude come from?  If you ask me, if you're here to put upon me, you're the one who's called upon to be friendly and accommodating.

23ac0l,cgv4eyd,"Nope, you're not the asshole.

Profiling people because of skin color or what they wear is a total dick move. Just because you have brown skin, a beard, and a turban doesn't mean you are a terrorist - in fact all it means is that you probably come from North India and you probably know a bunch of people with the last name Singh is all.

It's not even the ""right"" religion or the ""right"" country for the Islamic Terrorist trope. 

Not only is it flat out bigoted (what, the US hasn't had a ton of white Christian terrorists for decades all of a sudden?) it's just plain offensive. I don't go up to a North African person and say ""Yo, wassup dawg?"" because that's incredibly culturally insensitive.

If she *was* actually worried about anything other than her own stupid thoughts - if she was actually honestly concerned that your phone was going to blow up or something - she should have simply refused to take it. Did she think she was going to foil your small-town grocery store terrorist plot by expecting that you'd give an honest answer as to your intentions to blow up the store? Of course not. If she was *actually* concerned at all, she would have acted completely differently.

Could you imagine if you were African-American and you asked if it was okay to go out to your car to get your wallet and she said ""You aren't going to do a drive-by shooting on me, are you?"" People would lose their minds over a comment like that.

Maybe the food stamps comment was a little mean, but there's only one asshole in this story and it isn't you. You probably could have gotten her fired over that comment, but you chose not to pursue it.",9w3q5,11,1397764683.0,False

2. They probably have a shifty life in general. Much worse than yours
3. I feel pity for them
4. They might have a gun nearby
5. There might be other racist ignorants in the area that will side with the other party and/or be violent about it

To me, it's just not worth it. At some point you have to assume that it's the way the world works.

She becomes INCREDIBLY apologetic, and says, ""yes, I'm so sorry sir, that was very rude of me, yes sir, you ARE the one paying for my food stamps""

I don't buy this. You made an assumption that she was on food stamps, that you had no way of knowing. My reaction would be ""Fuck you, you don't know anything about me"", regardless of whether I was on food stamps or not.

>I say, ""here, take my phone as collateral""
She says, ""It's not going to blow up is it?""

Doesn't sound true either. She wouldn't accept it if she thought it was going to blow up. She would ask for an ID or something. 

>I say, ""here, take my phone as collateral"" 

Doesn't make any sense. Why would you give her your phone as collateral? You forgot your wallet in your car. That means you leave your shopping there to go get your wallet. Why would she let you take the shopping with you to your car when you have to come back immediately and pay for it anyway? You can leave it there and pay for it when you get back.

>Ask checkout lady (white, 55 years old) if I can go get it from my car

You know exactly how old she is?

Any relationship is costly, and you can probably learn more about relationships in general from this in the future. You were kind of an asshole, and certainly acted like one, being that blunt. Honesty could be the best policy, but you've got to combine that with tact. 

I'd put you at reasonable asshole. You're thinking your way through something she was clearly in for base reasons, and you're not empathizing. My birth father has ruined two marriages by not empathizing, and I'd place you in the same category here, so take my advice with a bit of secondhand experience.

Did she do anything before the sex to make it clear that she was looking for something serious?  You seem to want the issue to be whether it's right for her to be upset about a small stretch of time where she had the wrong impression.

Even though you didn't intend it that way and you were being honest about your intentions and changing your mind. That's what they sometimes say, too, and she has no way of knowing whether you're telling the truth or just BSing her.

Basically I don't think either of you are totally in the wrong, but you both made some mistakes.

What I *will* say is that it would have been a bit insensitive if you mentioned money issues getting in the way, but not assholey.  Focusing on the distance thing I think is fine.  90 minutes of driving every day is a lot.
